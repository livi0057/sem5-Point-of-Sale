# sem5-Point-of-Sale
My improved solution to seminar 3, Implementation.

Improvements made:
- Divided the method "enterItem" in Controller into two private methods.
- Made sure only the View handles the UI.
- Created more unit tests (ControllerTest, AccountingSystemTest, InventorySystemTest, SystemCreatorTest, CashPaymentTest, CashRegisterTest, SaleTest).
